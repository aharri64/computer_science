# Binary Trees and Tries

We’ve already learned about linked lists, a basic way to store data in nodes. Binary trees and tries are more advanced node-based structures that store data hierarchically from top to bottom (in the shape of, you guessed it, an actual tree). But here’s where we get fancy: Nodes in a binary tree or trie can point to more than one node! Let’s explore how this works.
