# Basic Sorting Algorithms

Ah, bubble sort. Unused, unloved, and the butt of so many jokes. It tries so hard, but it’s just... so... slow. And insertion sort isn’t too much better. In this lesson, we’ll cover the two most basic sorting algorithms, their complexity classes, and their implementations.

### TOPICS

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
